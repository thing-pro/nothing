这是一个和 GPT 沟通后创建的项目，用于学习 GPT，以及探索 GPT 在开发领域中的可行性，并且翻译也是GPT做的。

This is a project created after communicating with GPT, which is used to learn about GPT and explore its feasibility in the field of development，And the translation was also done by GPT.

今天让 GPT 以架构师的角色，帮助完成了基于命令的程序架构实际，我还是比较满意的。

Today, I am quite satisfied with letting GPT act as an architect to help complete the actual implementation of a command-based program architecture.

今天和 GPT 的沟通并不多，主要因为涉及到 WebGL 底层的封装，问题的回答总是不能促成完整的代码实现。于是为了完成今天的内容，简化了实现方案，让 GPT 先输出个大概的框架，然后根据作者的经验实现了一个比较简单的渲染器。（仅对mesh渲染，简单的 unlit 类型的材质）

Today, there wasn't much communication with GPT regarding the encapsulation of the underlying WebGL. The responses provided were not able to lead to a complete implementation of the code. Therefore, in order to accomplish today's tasks, a simplified approach was adopted. GPT was asked to output a rough framework, and based on the author's experience, a relatively simple renderer was implemented. This renderer only supports mesh rendering with basic unlit materials.
